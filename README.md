Face Recognition Using PCA

This is our final project in which we have used PCA in order to identify faces from a test data set and a simple GUI will show the result. 

Requirements:
1. All the images should be stored in a folder within same directory and the directories names should be renamed accordingly in the code
2. The original images should contains 5 facial features in a text file, one txt file for each image

Result :
We found that the accuracy with most of the images was above 68%.

Problems :
Some of the images were not searched correctly due to incorrect raw data.
